## Introduction
The Shortest Path Problem involves finding the shortest path from a starting point (0,0) to a destination point (i,j) in a grid. The grid may contain obstacles or have certain restrictions on movement. This directory presents two approaches: the greedy algorithm and dynamic programming, to solve this problem. By comparing these approaches and analyzing their performance, you can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is as follows:

* This directory contains the implementation of the greedy algorithm for finding the shortest path problem. The greedy algorithm selects the path step by step, making locally optimal choices, without considering the global optimal solution.

* This directory contains the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for finding the shortest path problem. The dynamic programming approach breaks down the problem into overlapping subproblems and solves them iteratively to find the optimal solution.

* This directory includes a comprehensive analysis of the performance and efficiency of both the greedy and dynamic programming algorithms. It provides metrics such as execution time and path length, allowing you to compare the algorithms' effectiveness.
