## Introduction
The Study Hours Allocation Problem involves deciding how to distribute study hours among various subjects to maximize grades. Given a set of subjects with their respective importance and required study hours, the goal is to find an optimal allocation that maximizes the overall grades. This directory presents two approaches: the greedy algorithm and dynamic programming, to solve this problem. By comparing these approaches and analyzing their statistical performance, you can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is as follows:

* This directory contains the implementation of the greedy algorithm for the Study Hours Allocation Problem. The greedy algorithm selects subjects based on their importance-to-study-hour ratio, aiming to maximize the overall grades while considering the available study hours.

* This directory contains the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for the Study Hours Allocation Problem. The dynamic programming approach solves the problem optimally by breaking it down into overlapping subproblems and finding the optimal solution using a table.

* This directory includes the full program implementations of both the greedy and dynamic programming algorithms, along with a comprehensive statistical analysis. The statistical analysis provides metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and grade improvement achieved by each algorithm.
