## Introduction
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items with weights and values, the goal is to determine the most valuable combination of items that can be packed into a knapsack with a weight capacity constraint.

This directory provides implementations of the Knapsack Problem using both greedy and dynamic programming algorithms. By comparing these approaches and analyzing their statistical performance, you can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is as follows:
