## Introduction
Algorithms play a vital role in solving complex computational problems. This repository focuses on the comparison between two widely used algorithmic approaches: dynamic programming and greedy strategies. By studying and implementing these techniques, I can gain insights into their application domains, time complexities, and their impact on solving various types of problems.

## Contents ./README_2.md [`Your Directory Name/`](./your-directory-name):
The repository currently includes the following:
- `KnapsackProblem/` This directory contains implementations of the Knapsack Problem.
- `MaxGradesProblem`: This directory contains implementations of the Maximum Grade Problem.
- `ShortestPath/`: This directory contains implementations of the Shortest Path Problem.
- `TwoBagsKnapsack/`: This directory contains implemetations of the Two Bags Knapsack Problem.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Explore the different directories mentioned in the [Contents](#contents) section.
4. Review the code examples, analysis, and relevant documentation to understand the concepts and implementations.

## Usage
The code in this repository is provided for educational purposes, allowing you to study and compare dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Feel free to use the implementations as a reference for your own projects, modify them, or expand upon them. Each directory contains its own README file with specific instructions and explanations.
