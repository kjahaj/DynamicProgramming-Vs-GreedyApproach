## Introduction
Algorithms play a vital role in solving complex computational problems. This repository focuses on the comparison between two widely used algorithmic approaches: dynamic programming and greedy strategies. By studying and implementing these techniques, I can gain insights into their application domains, time complexities, and their impact on solving various types of problems.

## Contents
The repository currently includes the following:
- `DynamicProgramming-Vs-GreedyApproach/Dynamic Programming Approaches/`: This directory contains implementations of dynamic programming algorithms for specific problem domains.
- `Greedy Algorithms/`: This directory contains implementations of greedy algorithms for specific problem domains.
- `examples/`: This directory showcases practical examples that demonstrate the differences between dynamic programming and greedy approaches.
- `analysis/`: This directory presents detailed analysis and evaluations of the performance and behavior of the algorithms in different scenarios.
- `contributing.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the repository.
