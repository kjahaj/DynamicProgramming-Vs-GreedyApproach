## Introduction
The Two-Bag Knapsack Problem involves selecting a set of items to pack into two separate bags in order to maximize the overall value. Each item has a weight and a value, and the bags have a weight capacity constraint. This directory presents two approaches: the greedy algorithm and dynamic programming, to solve this problem. By comparing these approaches and analyzing their performance, you can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure is as follows:

* This directory contains the implementation of the greedy algorithm for the Two-Bag Knapsack Problem. The greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step to select items for the bags.

* This directory contains the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for the Two-Bag Knapsack Problem. The dynamic programming approach breaks down the problem into overlapping subproblems and solves them iteratively to find the optimal solution.

* This directory includes a comprehensive analysis of the performance and effectiveness of both the greedy and dynamic programming algorithms. It provides metrics such as execution time and total value achieved by each algorithm, allowing you to compare their performance.
